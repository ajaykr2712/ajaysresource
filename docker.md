# Drooping some of the best cheatsheets of Devops and its related tools.

### A cheatsheet is a concise summary of important information that is meant to be used as a quick reference. Cheatsheets are often used in the form of a list or a table, and they typically cover a specific topic or subject area. In the context of Docker, a Docker cheatsheet is a summary of commonly used Docker commands and their options, as well as other useful information related to Docker.

### Cheatsheets can be particularly helpful when learning a new tool or technology, as they provide a convenient way to quickly look up and remind oneself of key concepts and commands. They can also be useful for experienced users who need to recall a specific command or option but may not remember all the details.
